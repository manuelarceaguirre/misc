## Agenda & Key Discussion Points

### 1. Committee Objective & Scope
- Oversight of the Model Risk Management (MRM) framework for AI/ML and traditional models.
- Ensure models are ethically developed and effectively governed.
- Charter confirmed (available in slide appendix).

### 2. Roles & Responsibilities
- Committee serves as escalation point for model risk concerns.
- Reviews independent validation plans, findings, trends, and model inventory.
- Distinct from working groups (oversight vs. execution).

### 3. Program Maturity & Guidelines
- Centralized SharePoint for MRM resources (templates, validation docs).
- Key references:
  - Farmers Risk Policy – Chapter 9, Section H
  - Technical Documentation Requirements
  - Independent Validation Guidelines (bias, qualitative/quantitative standards)

### 4. Independent Validation Plan
- Risk-based plan prioritizing 15 high-risk models.
- 1 model validated by Guy Carpenter (internal capital model) – found appropriate.
- Future summaries will be shared for all validations.

### 5. Third-Party Engagements
- Pinnacle Actuarial hired to support protected class analysis (CO law & bulletin compliance).
- Focus: bias detection, proxy usage, regulatory testing.
- Goal: internal capability building, not long-term outsourcing.

### 6. Intake & Inventory Updates
- Intake fields reduced from 86 to 73.
- Auto-complete logic implemented to simplify forms.
- Focus on improving model owner experience and data quality.

### 7. Training & Feedback
- Ongoing training sessions (next on April 1: qualitative aspects & bias).
- Low survey response rate – more feedback encouraged.
- Training materials available for replay and review.

### 8. Bias Detection & Collaboration
- Jason (DNA series) developing simplified bias detection guidance.
- Manuel collaborating to provide tools and scenarios for model owners.
- Workshop planned for bias scope and monitoring expectations.

### 9. Challenges & Next Steps
#### a. Model Risk Materiality
- Current pyramid inverted (most models flagged as high risk).
- Working group being formed to refine tiering criteria.
- Reassess AI-related model risk classifications.

#### b. ACTUAR Compliance
- Models using external data must show testing, monitoring, and evaluation for bias.
- Tools and frameworks in development for model owners.
- Ongoing monitoring expectations being defined.

#### c. Quickbase Enhancements
- Continued improvements to intake form and dashboard usability.
- Aim: reduce redundancy, improve transparency and adoption across business units.
