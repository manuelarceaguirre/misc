\section{Model Executive Summary}

The Zendesk AI Agents project, initiated by the New Ventures business unit, aims to enhance customer self-service and reduce customer contacts by implementing AI-powered agents. These agents provide relevant instructions directly to customers using public knowledge articles from the Zendesk help center. The project targets customers of Toggle, Farmers Direct brands, and Toyota Auto Insurance (Embedded Partner) who interact via the web widget on available websites.

The business purpose is to decrease customer contact volume by enabling AI agents to deliver immediate, accurate responses, thereby improving customer satisfaction and yielding annual savings of \$210,300 through reduced full-time equivalent (FTE) requirements. The model integrates with the Zendesk platform and relies on the availability of up-to-date public knowledge articles. It employs the GPT-4o model from OpenAI to generate context-aware responses.

Governance is managed by the New Ventures team, with Jonathan Groves and Steve Kim as primary contacts and Vanessa Jackson as the business sponsor. The project aligns with the broader customer support ecosystem, enhancing efficiency through increased first-contact resolution rates and higher deflection to lower-cost, non-phone channels. The significant methodology involves generative AI, specifically GPT-4o, which supports features like summarization, expansion, and tone adjustment for clear and concise responses.

Relevant documentation includes internal references on Zendesk AI integration and GPT-4o specifications, though specific titles are not provided here. As a new implementation targeting a start date of January 1, 2025, there is no model change history at this time.

    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Third-Party Involvement:} Zendesk (platform provider) and OpenAI (GPT-4o model supplier)
\end{itemize}

\section{Model Inputs}

The Zendesk AI Agents model uses text data from public knowledge articles in the Zendesk help center as its primary input, serving as the knowledge base for response generation.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Input Variables and Sources:} Text from public knowledge articles maintained in the Zendesk help center.
    \item \textbf{Overview of Data Quality:} Assumed to be accurate and up-to-date for public use, but specific metrics (accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, availability, appropriateness) are not provided.
    \item \textbf{Personal Information:} Public knowledge articles do not contain personal or Sensitive Personal Information. Customer queries may include personal data, but the model does not store or process it beyond response generation.
    \item \textbf{Data Cleansing, Pre-processing, and Transformations:} Not detailed in provided documents.
    \item \textbf{Assumptions about Input Variables:} Assumes articles are relevant and comprehensive for common queries; no trending or adjustment details provided.
    \item \textbf{Data Creation Date and Dataset Splits:} Not applicable; no traditional training/test/validation splits specified.
\end{itemize}

\section{Model Calculations}

The model leverages the GPT-4o generative AI model to produce responses based on public knowledge articles.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Algorithms Used:} Utilizes GPT-4o’s transformer-based architecture with self-attention mechanisms, pre-trained and adapted for context-aware response generation.
    \item \textbf{Model Logic Derivation:} Logic stems from GPT-4o’s training, enabling it to interpret queries and generate responses from the knowledge base.
    \item \textbf{Key Parameters and Assumptions:} Specific parameters (e.g., prompts, temperature settings) are not detailed; assumes configuration prioritizes accuracy and relevance.
\end{itemize}

\section{Model Outputs}

The model generates text responses to customer queries, delivered via web widget messaging channels.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Types of Metrics or Scores Produced:} Outputs are text responses; associated metrics may include deflection rates, customer satisfaction, and first-contact resolution rates.
    \item \textbf{Reporting of Model Results:} Responses are delivered to customers; performance is monitored via Zendesk dashboards and analytics tools.
    \item \textbf{Integration into Business Processes:} Supports customer support workflow, reducing human agent involvement and operational costs.
    \item \textbf{Relevant Metrics or Thresholds:} Not specified; key indicators may include response accuracy and resolution rates.
    \item \textbf{Summary of Performance:} Expected to increase deflection to lower-cost channels and first-contact resolution, contributing to \$210,300 annual savings.
\end{itemize}
